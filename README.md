# Benchmark-1
This project was created for benchmarking human tracing performance using different tools and methods.

The "Benchmark.jpeg" image is the primary file in this project. It has clearly defined regions of
black, gray, and white that were created from the boundaries of an actual EM image. Because the
regions are so clearly defined, any human "judgement" can be eliminated from the tracing process.
This provides a more objective basis for judging speed of tracing and for measuring of errors.

![Benchmark.jpeg](Benchmark.jpeg?raw=true "Benchmark.jpeg")

For easier reference, each closed region of the image is numbered with the following key image:

![Benchmark_Key.jpeg](Benchmark_Key.jpeg?raw=true "Benchmark_Key.jpeg")

The closed regions are numbered (mostly clockwise) as:

| Regions |

| 1 |
